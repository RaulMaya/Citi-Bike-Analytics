### <u>Background</u>

<br>

Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the [New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike) Program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

* What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?

  In 2019 and 2020 the average distance that a bike ride, was of 0.629 miles. If we split the average in months we get that the average distance ridden by miles in months, behave like this:

    - January: 0.59 miles (average)
    - February, March: 0.60 miles (average)
    - April, May: 0.61 miles (average)
    - June, December: 0.62 miles (average)
    - July: 0.76 miles (average)
    - August, November: 0.63 miles (average)
    - September, October: 0.64 miles (average)

  As we can appreciate, there is a strange phenomena in July, because al the averages across the months are (0.615 +- 2) miles on average, but in July the average increase to 0.76 miles. Making a research we detect that the maximum distance in in July was of 5389.259 miles, so there must be and individual that try to break a record in July, or use a Citi Bike to ride across New York City.
